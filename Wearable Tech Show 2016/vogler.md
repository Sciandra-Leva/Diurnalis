#Creating the Driverless Car
###Speaker: Andreas Vogler
###Date: 15-03-2016
###Conference event: The Wearable Technology Show 2016

In this session our speakers will look at the future of the driverless connected car and the apps and services that make sense. Ultimately what does this mean for the understanding of cars as a product and for cars utilisation value?
 
######My Actual Notes

A driverless car is important for business if it is always connected, and has smart content.

The Smart Car of the future will have:
- Has its own IT infrastructure (2016)
- Is connected with the internet (2016)
- Is connected with other smart hardware (2020)
- Is self-driving (2020) 
- Is autonomously operating (no need for parking sport) (20XX)

Going on with more predictions:
- Screen
    The in-car screens will expand and will finally take center stage, even replacing the steering wheel
- Platform
    It will develop from a pure driving device to a service platform with driving functionalities
- Yield On Services
    THe revenues from services and utilization will add to or even replace large parts of the sales revenues of the car
- App Store
    Needs an app store filled with useful apps for delivering added value for end-user
- Custom
    It's a technological standard platform which can v individualized 
- Adopt
    It will happen as for smartphone, people won't believe until they try it.

A car will be more or less a peripheral device for your smartphone: and probably they'll share the same app store.

So, these new cars will force a change of paradigm and perspective:
* A car will be used as a smart advertising billboard
* Tool for attracting customers to stores
* Fully equipped working space on wheels
* Platform for moving cargo by mouse click
* Equipment for experiencing driving pleasure
* Mobile Lounge for delivering services

They are still working on something on this change of paradigm... Metropolis.
