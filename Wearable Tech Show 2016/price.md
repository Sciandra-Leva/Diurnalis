#Mobile VR – Turning Social Networks into Sociable Networks
###Speaker: Julian Price
###Date: 15-03-2016
###Conference event: The Wearable Technology Show 2016

Social networks really aren’t social.
Mobile VR presents an opportunity to turn social networks into truly sociable experiences offering the possibility of spending quality time with family and friends in virtual destinations and sharing experiences together virtually from any device. Existing social networks promote digital narcissism, whereas sociable VR networks creates a whole new world of sociable possibilities. As Larry Rosen, a professor of psychology at California State University said; “We tap out brief missives and believe that we are being sociable, but as psychologist Sherry Turkle has so aptly said, we are only getting “sips” of connection, not real communication.” This session will look how developers can maximize the possibilities offered by mobile VR to create real, sociable networks where people genuinely connect and socialize – and how we encourage repeat engagement and real communication.
