#Making a Connected Home a Reality
###Speaker: Philip Steele
###Date: 15-03-2016
###Conference event: The Wearable Technology Show 2016

Smart technology allows billions of devices to create the Internet of Things. This session explores how wearables work in tandem with smart objects to help manage and improve your life. What are the options for home control and how does wearable technology work alongside these devices?

######My Actual Notes

What is a connected home?
Philip Steele -> consumers don't get the whole picture, they just want a particular service or devices. 

There is a difference between a connected house and a smart house. This is defined by how the devices inside the house interact.

3 things are going to happen:
-> The IoT that won't work as we expected 
-> Assisted living (elder people) (hand to hand with assurance companies)
-> *????*

Every country is so different it is a really complex chain!

Security is a way into this market.
Projection is 12% of adption in EU.

Are there any standards ways of interaction with a smart house? Probably gestures.

Bandwidth is going to be a bottleneck for future smart houses, we'll have so many devices that the classic network contract won't be available.

The interesting thing is the Amazon Echo: it's easy to use! And it works on the IP backbone.

The fight will be on creating the echosystem (like the Sony TV connected to the Playstation Network, Steam home, etc)

Do wearables helps in creating a smart home?
It's a new way of interacting with it.

They won't be a key point but "another item" to interact with it.

Parents want to know when kids get home!

Where in the value chain the wearables will be in? (the million dollar question)

The market is flooded with HUBs, but non of those is the market standard.

Echo is becoming the model. Interact using "talk" may (or may not) be the future.

The multiple provider model won't survive: T-mobile, etc won't survive. Enel (power suppliers) will be the first in line to connect your home... they are already inside.

There is also a Privacy angle to the smart house issue: should my data even go in the cloud? Or those can just stay in the house, giving the user full control on what leaves.

Saving will be part of the "take to market" strategy, but won't be a core necessity for the client. (the bottom line is that it will be market driven)
The message (the commercial aspect of it) will be more granular, and people don't care of saving moneys.

People want simple tactile infrastructures. One ring to control them all (one app, of course): all will work together.

*_Alexa is being put in 4 General Motors cars!!!_*

Speed and confort will move the market.
