#Smart Cities â€“ Creating Intelligent Transport Systems
###Speaker: Geoff Snelson & Christos Voudouris
###Date: 15-03-2016
###Conference event: The Wearable Technology Show 2016

The panel will consider the potential of the IOT in helping cities to offer better transport systems and improve quality of life and how it can help cities to address trends such as traffic congestion, environmental awareness and improving quality of life.

######My Actual Notes

50 Million $s are not enough to create a feature for a smart city.

Across the motor industries they are all developing business focused on car as a service more than a possession.

So cars are used really inefficiently, and something should be done in this way.

But what about drones? They can be mainly used to collect information about the traffic datas.

There is a "live locally" scenario which imagines that in the future we'll move less around thanks to the applications like skype and such.
And this will probably have an impact on transportations.
