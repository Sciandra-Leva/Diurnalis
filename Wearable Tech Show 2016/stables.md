#The Future of Wearable Technology
###Speaker: James Stables

###Conference event: The Wearable Technology Show 2016

Where are wearables headed? With the changes to Google Glass and the imminent arrival of Apple watch, our experts discuss the way ahead and in particular which form function they think will be most appealing to consumers primarily looking at mobility in the enterprise.

######My Actual Notes

We are still trying to scratch the surface in Wearable. We are going to see a big wave of innovation coming from the industries like Healthcare, Security, etc.

They don't see apparently much innovation in the consumer world because it's more focuses on design.

They are seeing a merging of the consumer wearable into the enterprise, mainly in wellness. At Salesfoce they use those to gamify the wellness of the employes (they make offices challenge at sports).

Will company encourage wellness?
In US Saleforces is going deep into this, they also try to keep them healthy, giving bonuses to not-smoking people and such.*(How about UK?)*

Anyway, Wearable is moving from product to service: even assurance companies may start to use this sort of wearable.

Wearable may be even used to signal emergencies: like, a band that when giving a particular series of taps to let me know an earthquake is coming.

Which form factor will prevail?

IBM -> Gloves, Hands-free, AR, Wrist as a way of presenting information

Kinneir -> something not relying on display (distraction free devices)

Salesforce -> In the enterprise equipment (safety helmet, safety googles), earpieces for elder people (Apple is going to release something BIG in headsets, that's why the bought Beats)

Maybe, as interaction vector, voice (Siri-like) is going to be killer feature. But it needs to be a human interaction, not an answer machine.

The glass form factor, even being something a lot of people wears, has been a failure. Why.

"Glassholes" -> People wearing Google Glass

The problem with those was that is was like a big red flashing light on their head... and privacy is an issue to that.

In the consumer world it is really important the appearance of the wearables, people needs to feel cool with those on.

IBM -> enterprise is the future of wearable
Kinneir -> disappear is the future of wearable (embedded in something else, not different from the standard version)
Saleforces -> it's all about context. The human is going to be the vector of the journey which all these devices will talk and know what are you doing, right away.
