#Biosyncing: Symbiosis Between Human and Machine
###Speaker: Denis Hurley
###Date: 15-03-2016
###Conference event: The Wearable Technology Show 2016

Biosyncing refers to bio-mechanical symbiosis; when a human and a machine are in a reactive, performance-augmenting loop. It describes behavioural changes on the part of humans, based on mechanical feedback, and machines learning from human responses, making alterations automatically. For example, responding to information delivered from wearable devices or adaptive computer program responding to a human's biometric data. 

**Takeaways**:

- Biosyncing communications between the physical and virtual worlds
- Biological and mechanical interactions - facial recognition, haptic feedback, eye tracking and vocal commands
- Synchronous human-machine micro-improvements
- Successful biosyncing loopâ€™s/ automatic reactive states
- Improvement of artificial intelligence

######My Actual Notes

Biosyncing: sensors capture our parameters and *respond* to our current status.

Some supporting technologies for this are **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Mixed Reality** (VR where you have to **NOT** use controllers to interact).

They developed some products with these techs: see picture.

At Pearson they are studying growing in and out of VR.

*"It's really about immersion"*

The more you are immersed into VR the more succesful education will be given.

Successful biosyncing is determinated by how many decisions we don't take consciously.
