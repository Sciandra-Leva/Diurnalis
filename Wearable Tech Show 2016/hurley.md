#Biosyncing: Symbiosis Between Human and Machine
###Speaker: Denis Hurley
###Date: 15-03-2016
###Conference event: The Wearable Technology Show 2016

Biosyncing refers to bio-mechanical symbiosis; when a human and a machine are in a reactive, performance-augmenting loop. It describes behavioural changes on the part of humans, based on mechanical feedback, and machines learning from human responses, making alterations automatically. For example, responding to information delivered from wearable devices or adaptive computer program responding to a human's biometric data. 
Takeaways:
-Biosyncing communications between the physical and virtual worlds
-Biological and mechanical interactions - facial recognition, haptic feedback, eye tracking and vocal commands
-Synchronous human-machine micro-improvements
-Successful biosyncing loopâ€™s/ automatic reactive states
-Improvement of artificial intelligence
