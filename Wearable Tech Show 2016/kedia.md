###Speaker: Pankaj Kedia
###Date: 15-03-2016
###Conference event: The Wearable Technology Show 2016

The smart wearables market segment is experiencing strong growth and promises to proliferate 100s of millions of devices to various parts of our bodies. In this keynote, Pankaj Kedia will elaborate on the opportunities and challenges that lay ahead. This keynote will outline the recipe for success in this exciting segment and will also discuss Qualcommâ€™s strategy and how it is working with key players in the ecosystem.

######My Actual Notes

Projections says that we are going to have around 15 BILLIONS connected devices over the next few years.

So **Internet of Things** is the next big thing. At Qualcomm they divide it into 3 categories:
- Smart Bodies
- Smart Homes
- Smart Cities

In their vision, multiple wearable per person are the future, and those are connected with each other.

*"No matter how you slice it, these numbers are up and to the right."*

Basically, these wearables will give us a 6th sense. 

We can divide them into categories (see picture)

Last but not least, these things are getting smarter.

The foundation of a *strategy* is to DELIVER Performance Optimized Across Wearable Segments.

4 Vectors of Wearable Innovation:
- Small Size (you want them to disappear on you)
- Low Power consumption
- Smart Sensing
- Always Connected

On top of this foundation is important to ENABLE a thriving ecosystem of software and hardware.

*(this is the Qualcomm strategy)*

More than 65 wearable devices are already running Qualcomm tech.

But the next thing: the new Qualcomm Snapdragon _WEAR_ (a new subbrand)! They made it 30% smaller of the Snapdragon 400, 25% less consuming.
It has an integrated ultra low power sensor HUB, for more accurate data and analysis.
It has ALL required wireless connections: LTE, 3G, WiFI, BT, GNSS, NFC.

They are already working on Android with partners, and this announcement is actually one month old.
