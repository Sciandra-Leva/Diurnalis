#Smart City Infrastructures â€“ The Opportunities and Challenges
###Speaker: Michael Mulquin
###Date: 15-03-2016
###Conference event: The Wearable Technology Show 2016

This session will look at the ways of integrating the energy, water, waste, transport and telecoms infrastructures in cities
The key infrastructures needed to make cities work are becoming increasingly integrated with each other as the potential synergies are becoming evident.
However, this interdependence also introduces new vulnerabilities and the potential of catastrophic failure.
How can these infrastructures be managed to exploit the potential synergies and mitigate failure, and what is the role of IoT in this?

######My Actual Notes

This man is pure hype.
Every bit of the city needs to be smarter to create a proper Smart City. (see picture)

The interesting part is that these services are *complicated*, because humans are involved.

So these services must be "infinitely customisable"... becaus of this, 
- many public sector IoT applications are niche
- not always easy to penetrate new markets globally
- not always easy for cities to use products developed for cities in other countries

Therefore products are mainly consumer focused.

On the other hand, smart *infrastructures* are simple: their role is simply to get "things" from where they are to where they need to be in the city as quickly and efficiently as possible.

The requirements are simple too:
- to ensure that the networks are functioning efficiently - no leaks or blockages
- to identify and localize properly

And IoT are quite good at this.

These infrastructures are indipendent from each other: which is good.. and bad.

IoT can help mainly in some areas (see picture)

So a lot of opportunities.

But we can focus on the single things: we ned to focus on the bigger picture.
(see picture for an example)

That's where data can help making much better decisions about the "system of systems".

Another big topic, is how risk should be handled, and mitigated. So as we start to make infrastructures smart, we need to ensur that the risks of negative impacts are not so severe as to undermine the business.

He's now showing some examples, one from NY (see picture), another from San Francisco (see picture), Minneapolis (see picture).
Two more examples (see pictures) Milwaukee and Santa Clara.

These IoT applications can be used anywhere! That's huge!
