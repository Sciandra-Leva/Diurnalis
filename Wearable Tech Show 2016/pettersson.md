#Making the Right Connection: Understanding Wireless Protocol Options for the IoT
###Speaker: Anders Pettersson
###Date: 15-03-2016
###Conference event: The Wearable Technology Show 2016

When designing for the Internet of Things, it’s vital to understand the benefits and best use cases for each of the different wireless protocols available. The choices vary significantly for battery-operated devices versus powered devices and for sensors with small amounts of information versus streaming video or audio-capable devices. Existing wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi, ZigBee and Bluetooth are readily available, each offering benefits or drawbacks depending on the use case. New protocols such as Thread provide ultra-low-power, IP-based connectivity for mesh networks. This presentation will evaluate leading wireless protocol options and how they fit unique IoT design requirements and provide an optimal end user experience.

######My Actual Notes

He started with a panoramic over the Wireless technologies (see picture), and he's now moved to Network Topology.

*pic1*

Different networks for different needs: see picture.

One main difference is when having to handle a proprietary technology, which has some pros and cons.
Surely those will give you a homogenous network, which brings in only the devices you will actually want inside.

But those won't be able to communicate with standard protocols.

In IoT applications the existing protocols are a mix of IP and non-IP stacks.
There is a lot of innovation surrounding these IP based solutions, like the one they are showing, Threat (a new protocol).

In Sub GHz world most of the technologies are proprietary, then there's Bluetooth and BT Smart (which corrects the power consumption issue).

But these low-range technologies are not usable in a Smart Home situation (I don't want to bring around my cellphone just to turn on/off the lights).

Wi-Fi is the most widely used protocol, and it is considered "easy to use" by consumers.

**ZigBee** (see picture)

*pic3*

**Thread**: in the automation world this is the coolest thing ever. It is a secure wireless mesh networking protocol.
It is build on standards: 6LoWPAN / 802.15.4 radios.
It is reliable (self healing networks, with no single point of failure) and secure (uses banking class encryption); and it is also simple (simple yet secure commissioning of new nodes to a network).

(see picture for layering of Thread)

Which protocol should I choose?

*All of Them!*
That's the correct answer.

This put some pression -> "2016 is the year of the gateway"

Multiradio products are needed, but the multiprotocol is still up to the single application (meaning it depends on the use case).

In the future we'll see products able to switch radio protocol right away.

So:
- One size does **NOT** fit all
- Understand technology choice
- Multiple protocols capable radios provide the greatest flexibility
