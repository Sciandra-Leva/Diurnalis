#The Future of the Connected Home

###Date: 15-03-2016
###Conference event: The Wearable Technology Show 2016

As connected products move from drawing board to shop shelf, what does the future hold for the connected home? While there are many factors that will influence this, Kassir will look at three areas having a profound impact on the future:
- The importance of companies designing products for the masses. The tech savvy consumer has already embraced connectivity, despite its initial challenges and costs. The challenge now, and one that Hive is embracing, is to create products that anyone and everyone can use and benefit from in their everyday life
- Encouraging consumer adoption. Creating products that everyone can use and benefit from is just one part of the puzzle. Educating consumers and removing perceived barriers to entry is critical if we are to see connected homes having a positive impact across the board
- Disappearing architectures and interfaces. Simplicity is key and consumers want the control a connected home can deliver to be simple and straightforward. How the industry addresses the issue of multiple architecture and interfaces is key. Without streamlining this mass adoption will be an insurmountable challenge
