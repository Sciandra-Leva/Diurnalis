######My Actual Notes

(arrived a bit late... thanks snow)
You have more chances to have fake friends in LinkedIn than on Facebook.. and more over since it is considered a safe/professional environment people *talk* way too much.
In a way, being the security guy and being an archeologist is similar, mostly regarding how you have to approach the work, which set of government rules you have to follow etc etc.
Lately even universities are focusing on "Cyber War": the thing is that many things changed but not the scope or how to do it (social engineering).
So we should not focus on data analysis and such, but on psychology! Since humans are still the fragile part of an attack, we should work on that.
In Courmayeur there is a key point of the electric power coming to Italy from France, if we could shut that one down there would be a massive power outrage in all Italy.
Aosta has quite the story: the emperor decided to send here (to keep the local tribes chill) only the "old" Pretorians.

TL,DR: We have some big issues with the actual CEOs since they know nothing, or they underestimate cybersecurity.
In the next 20 years the things will get better, but still... we have to get through 19.9 year.
THe big flaw now is about Privacy and proper usage of technology; apparently one of the main ways to address could be to have high fines. 
The thing is that in USA there is something like that, in EU not: and this also have a problem here, because having a "global" rule about this would basically means that EU would inject an USA law.


######The speaker bio

Independent Historian & Cultural Events Manager, Switzerland With a PhD in Roman Archaeology obtained at the University of Lausanne,  a Postdoctoral Research Degree in History and Sociology at the Romanian Academy of Sciences, Cluj-Napoca Branch and a Habilitation in History obtained at the Babes-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, Laurent CHRZANOVSKI teaches at the doctoral school of the University Lyon II Lumière as well as at the Faculties of History of Cluj and Sibiu Universities.
Obliged by his wife to enter the domain of internet and then the niche of cyber security, Laurent is responsible for the international relations, and head organizer of the yearly congress “Cybersecurity in Romania. An International public-private dialogue platform“. He also conceived the awareness-raising exhibition “Social media heroes, social media victims. From hieroglyphs to Facebook” designed for the Romanian Mission at the UNOG and first shown at the ITU headquarters (Geneva) in 2013. Contaminated by the virus, he delivered a few conferences in cyber security congresses, mainly based on the necessary philosophy and trans-disciplinary approaches needed to understand the phenomenon. His professional dreams are to keep his beloved lamps (main part of his academic research) out of reach of cyber-attacks by forbidding untested network-enabled LEDs and to introduce stratigraphical techniques in security strategies.
