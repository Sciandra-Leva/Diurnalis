After the Hacking Team's leak, it looks like the whole world just realized that mobile phones can be intercepted. Malware, spyware, key loggers.... there's plenty of choices for the cybercriminals, your competitors, your wife, whoever. This presentation will provide a high-level view on the topic, with real life evidences, advises and suggestions, from our field experience in the Digital Forensics world.

### My Actual Notes

She works in digital forensics; there are 4 phases:

```
- Evidence Collection/Acquisition
- Evidence Preservation
- Evidence Analysis
- Evidence  (last and most important)
```

Digital forenser = IT Background + Perfect Organizer + Genius + IT&no Skills + Legal & Pshycological & Geopolitical skills

Spy softwares (spywares) are a technology which gather information about a person or an organization without their knowledge. This kind of software can be installed on mobile devices, even the iPhones not jailbroken. And it's easy to find, and there are also difference in the sale level (normal, premium, etc)... and those are sold as parental control softwares.

During one forensic analysis they found inside the java source files numbers pointing to a china mobile.

Apparently iCloud is able to decrypt the users backup on its own, in some situations.

Also, Google apparently knows every password of every wifi every Android phone has been logged into.

As always the best counter-measure is to **educate users**.
