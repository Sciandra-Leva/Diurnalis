Improv talk about [BackBox Linux](https://www.backbox.org/).

######My Actual Notes

Backbox is a Linux Ubuntu-based distro designed for penatration tests and security assessments, fully volunteered.

Mostly used at enterprise level.

It is completely independent: they have sponsors but those don't influence the actual development of the platform, which is completely open source.

It is an italian distro which is, as always, completely unknown in Italy.

It has some cool features like "Anonymous".
