#Crossing ICT Events through transparent partnerships: the role of ICT Security
###Speaker: Gianluigi Ferri (IT) 
###Date: 05-03-2015
###Conference event: GrappaHat 2016

A perfect marriage between Service Robotics and Cognitive Computing: Internet of Toys. An open discussion about technical, security, privacy and ethics issues

######My Actual Notes

So, apparently IoT has a new dimension: TOYS.
There have been already some cases of toys hacked (Barbie, etc), so apparently "smart toys" is still fresh and unprotected.

An example of smart toy is [JIBO](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/jibo-the-world-s-first-social-robot-for-the-home#/), and another is [VAI KAI](http://vaikai.com/).
In the future probably these toys will be based on something Watson-like, meaning they'll be able to access some artificial intelligence. 

This is actually a big deal, these are TOYS, made for KIDS. They should be protected, but even CE can't make enough.

It's not only about having strict rules with the producer, it's also regarding parents: they must be aware of these sort of issues.
