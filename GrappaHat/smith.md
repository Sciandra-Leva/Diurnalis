#Fredo, you broke my HART (a story of moral turpitude and vagina dentata in the petroleum industry)
###Speaker: Matthew D. Smith (UK)
###Date: 05-03-2015
###Conference event: GrappaHat 2016

A story of moral turpitude and vagina dentata in the petroleum industry. From honeytraps to honeypots, giving head to get the wellhead. Pwned by a filthy vector in the dark underbelly of offshore life.

######My Actual Notes

The host started talking about this speaker saying "he's weird".
"Kepp calm and play the long game"
He works in the oil&gas industry... he started by showing us pictures of an oil extraction structure in open sea.
One main point is that it is physically exploitable!
And there is also the social engineering side, usually people working there have some sort of issue.
Organized crimes can play the long game: even going into love life.
It's all about the money in the end.
He's using variations of the Keep Calm meme to give the rythm of the story he's telling.
Classic xkcd picture.
More narration... but not really much more to write: he's acting a good thriller story to raise awareness about exploitation this oli&gas platfroms.

20-30 years to fix this human/infrastructural issue.

######The speaker bio

Matthew D. Smith started his career in the electricity industry, supporting distribution network metering and telecontrol systems for Africa’s largest utility. A few years later he finds himself dropped into the middle of the Niger Delta, looking after ancient log interpretation computers, a rather flaky satellite uplink and a local microwave network. During the downturn in 1999 with oil priced at $9 a barrel he manages to convince management to invest a rather lot of money in new network infrastructure to improve operational efficiency. After adventures in West Africa he moves into a corporate role located in Paris, joining a global infrastructure team responsible for transformational projects to strengthen the network backbone, building new core services and outsourcing arrangements. Seven years later he moves to a ‘secret’ outpost in the French Alps with a product development role focused on remote applications and connectivity enablers. He is responsible for worldwide deployment of a new mobile satellite network for field crews and machine to machine services.
In 2009 he creates his own company, fieldcloud SAS to provide cybersecurity and IT professional services, secure connectivity solutions and manufacture ruggedized, low power network computing platforms for energy and resources applications in hostile environments.
