#Tales from the humble computer shop guy
###Speaker: Paolo “aspy” Giardini (IT)

###Conference event: GrappaHat 2016

The title of this talk it’s a joke :)
The goal of my presentation is to introduce the audience to my job or, better to say, my professional activities. Indeed, along 25 years of career, while starting as “the computer shop guy”, then I evolved to Software Developer, “the Wolf of the Network” (I was fixing things), System Administrator, Digital Forenser, Privacy Officer, Court Trial Witness Expert, and OSINT Analyst; eventually “makes of formats” for the Treasure’s Hunting hacker game [“The CAT”](http://www.craccaaltesoro.it).
What does all of the above mean? It’s very simple! Don’t get stuck up to your job profile, learn from your actual professional engagement , then grow up and apply what you learned to the next one. Be always curious, don’t give up studying. Keep on looking for the Big Picture, not forgetting your roots, and those people who believed in you and helped out during previous years.
Giving all of the above (wow!), during my talk I will tell you some tales which I personally encountered, since I was the Computer Shop Guy ‘till the OSINT Analyst. With one clear though in mind: do always be humble!

Ok apparently we are not allowed to say anything about his talk. A pity, seems it's going to be fun.
