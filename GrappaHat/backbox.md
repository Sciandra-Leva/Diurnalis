Improv talk about BackBox Linux.

######My Actual Notes

Backbox is a Linux Ubuntu-based distro designed for penatration tests and security assessments, fully volunteered.

Mostly used in business.

It is completely indipendent, they have sponsors but those doesn't influence the code.
Completely open source.

It is an italian distro which, as always, completely unknown in Italy.

It has some cool features like "Anonymous".
