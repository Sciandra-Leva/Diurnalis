#Flight Control Repeaters/Towers: a case study
###Speaker: Sylvain Maret (CH) 
###Date: 05-03-2015
###Conference event: GrappaHat 2016

This talk will focus on a real project for critical communication within an ANSP.

######My Actual Notes

No pictures allowed. Now you have my attention.

ANSP = air navigation service provider

In 2009 is was decided by the EUROCAE that the communication between ATM ground and AIR has to be VoIP.
He had to work to make it possible, by creating a new architecture paradigm.

To test new solutions they used a standard list of steps:
    - choose radio
To buy some, you have to go on their websites and read specs.

    - RFI/RFP

    - feedback to vendors
Obviously talking with clients always create issues because of the different technical languages.

    - pentest

    - finalize architecture
    
"Network is secure, we don't need to secure the radio" - every vendor after they found 10 zero day.

A pilot is talking now! Everyone is looking at him; and he's asking about hacking the actual airplane (sadly the speaker never worked on that part of the issue)
