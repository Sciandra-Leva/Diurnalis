# Diurnalis

_Coined as a translation for the Ancient Greek ἡμερούσιος ‎(hēmeroúsios, "daily") from the roots diurnus ‎("of or belonging to the day") +‎ -ālis (suffix forming adjectives of relationship)._

## What is this about

This is a small experiment to keep the notes I take during the various conferences I manage to "sneak in".

I chose GitHub as platform to keep them available for everyone to improve (or read).

## The structure of this experiment

Every conference I'll add will have its own folder, and every talk its .md file. At root level there is a small template I will use for each keynote: it has a lot of room for improvement (still learning Markdown).

_Moreover_, I'm using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which is still in beta but it is _amazing_.
