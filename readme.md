#Diurnalis
*Coined as a translation for the Ancient Greek ἡμερούσιος ‎(hēmeroúsios, “daily”) from the roots diurnus ‎(“of or belonging to the day”) +‎ -ālis (suffix forming adjectives of relationship).*

##What is this about
This is a small experiment to keep the notes I take during the various conferences I manage to sneak in.

I chose GitHub as platform to keep them available for everyone to improve (or read).

##Who am I
I am the classic software developer ;)

Currently I try to understand how __Ruby on Rails__, __Docker__ and __NodeJs__ work. And __AWS__ too (yeah, all of it).
(Wanna know more? Later this year I'll release a proper website, don't worry - in the meantime, you can find me on LinkedIn)

##The structure of this experiment
Every conference I'll add will have its own folder, and every talk its .md file.
At root level there is a small template I will use for each keynote: it has a lot of room for improvement, I'm still learning Markdown.

*Moreover*, I'm using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which is still in beta but it is amazing*
