##What is this about
This is a small experiment to keep the notes I take at various conferences.
I chose GitHub as platform to keep them available for everyone to improve (or read).

##Who am I
I am the classic software developer ;)
Which basically means that GitHub is like a second home to me, since my current interests are Ruby on Rails, Docker and NodeJs.

##The structure of this experiment
Every conference I'll add will have its own folder, and every keynote its .md file.
At root level there is a small template I will use for each keynote: it has a lot of room for improvement, i'm still learning Markdown.

-Moreover, I'm using WriteMonkey to write these notes.
