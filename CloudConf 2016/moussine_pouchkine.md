# Google Cloud Vision API: What a Great Time to be a Developer!

## Speaker: Alexis Moussine-Pouchkine

## Conference event: CloudConf 2016

With everything that the Cloud has to offer nowadays it's really never been more exciting to be a developer. We've had virtualized datacenters for a while now and these were great to get resources on demand, but an actual elastic global cloud is what we're starting to see emerge. So whether you are a startup CTO, a developer, or or an architect, you now have everything at you fingertips to test new ideas, to fail fast, to iterate, and to succeed. You can now scale your apps and data without having to rethink your architecture. You have open source technologies such as containers and Kubernetes to define workloads that can run in a public cloud, on premise, or in a hybrid model with no lock-in and yet an abstraction level that allows you to focus on your application, not on the underlying infrastructure. And finally Google is working hard on making machine learning accessible to all and we'll see how the Google Cloud Vision API is opening up an entire new class of opportunities for application developers. Really, there's never been a better time to be a developer!

### My Actual Notes

Conf after the coffee break.

_(Which I spent talking to Poccia, such a nice guy)_

Asking question and finding the best answers is not that easy, but it's our job as developers to do so.

The Google hardware infrastructure is probably its most valuable asset (people aside). That's why it's really important to have a reliable file system/architecture to avoid that hardware failures can disrupt a service.

Since early 2000's Google worked on file systems and such, most recently is Kubernetes (and TensorFlow).

Apps should anticipate users' needs! And the only way to do so is by analyzing data.

At Google they call Big Data.... Data.  _Such joke, much wow._

Now we want to build clusters, over machines. Containers over computers. Moving from hardware issues to software.

To do that Machine Learning is really a key feature, which is enabled in TensorFlow. -> Translate is an easy example of Machine Learning at Google.

**Google Cloud Vision API** -> WYSIWYG It's an API able to return a JSON telling us what Google actually see in a picture we POST. (it can even recognize the dog race... wow)

Ok he may have tried a bit too hard with the picture of the city palace, but the other pictures worked great.

Ok, he's showing how great this API is, and let me tell you. _It really is. Hooooly cow._

There is also a free tier for Developers who wants to use its most advanced features. This API doesn't require you to be a Machine Learning expert, he's not and none in his staff is. Google is doing all the heavy work.

"Now go outside and build something awesome!" (sure will)

There are limits on images per second (24) and no video support for now.

### The conference description

The big european event on cloud computing and scalability The Cloud Conf is coming back after the successful 2013, 2014 and 2015 editions. The goal is always the same: make a great day full of networking and technical speeches about cloud computing, involving (as in the past) great companies and speakers (in the previous editions: AWS, Zend Technologies, OpenStack, OrientDB, Redis, Cloud9 IDE, Spotify, ElasticSEarch...) The CloudConf is suited for developers, devOps, startups e IT managers, and it will be hosted in Turin, a fantastic and dynamic italian city. Don't miss it!
