#Connecting the Unconnected: IoT made simple
###Speaker: Max Amordeluso
###Date: 10-03-2016
###Conference event: CloudConf 2016

Connecting physical devices to the cloud can enhance the user experience. AWS IoT is a new managed service that enables Internet-connected things (sensors, actuators, devices, and applications) to easily and securely interact with each other and the cloud.
In this session, we will discuss how constrained devices can send data to the cloud and receive commands back to the device. Devices can securely connect using MQTT, HTTP, Websockets protocols  and developers can leverage several features of AWS IoT such as the Rules Engine and Thing Shadows to quickly and easily build a real connected product.
