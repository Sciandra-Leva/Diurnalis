######The conference description

The big european event on cloud computing and scalability
The Cloud Conf is coming back after the successful 2013, 2014 and 2015 editions.
The goal is always the same: make a great day full of networking and technical speeches about cloud computing, involving (as in the past) great companies and speakers (in the previous editions: AWS, Zend Technologies, OpenStack, OrientDB, Redis, Cloud9 IDE, Spotify, ElasticSEarch...)
The CloudConf is suited for developers, devOps, startups e IT managers, and it will be hosted in Turin, a fantastic and dynamic italian city. Don't miss it!
