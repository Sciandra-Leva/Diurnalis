#Testing at Scale with Docker
###Speaker: Emil Stolarsky
###Date: 10-03-2016
###Conference event: CloudConf 2016

It's impossible to iterate quickly on a product without a reliable, responsive CI system. At a certain point, traditional CI providers don't cut it. Last summer, Shopify outgrew its CI solution and was plagued by 20 minute build times, flakiness, and waning trust from developers in CI statuses. Now our new CI builds Shopify in under 5 minutes, 700 times a day, spinning up 30,000 docker containers in the process.
This talk will cover the architectural decisions we made and the hard lessons we learned so you can design a similar build system to solve your own needs.

The goal is always the same: make a great day full of networking and technical speeches about cloud computing, involving (as in the past) great companies and speakers (in the previous editions: AWS, Zend Technologies, OpenStack, OrientDB, Redis, Cloud9 IDE, Spotify, ElasticSEarch...)
The CloudConf is suited for developers, devOps, startups e IT managers, and it will be hosted in Turin, a fantastic and dynamic italian city. Don't miss it!
