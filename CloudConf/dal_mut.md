The goal is always the same: make a great day full of networking and technical speeches about cloud computing, involving (as in the past) great companies and speakers (in the previous editions: AWS, Zend Technologies, OpenStack, OrientDB, Redis, Cloud9 IDE, Spotify, ElasticSEarch...)
The CloudConf is suited for developers, devOps, startups e IT managers, and it will be hosted in Turin, a fantastic and dynamic italian city. Don't miss it!
