#The Internet Is a Computer
###Speaker: Aanand Prasad
###Date: 10-03-2016
###Conference event: CloudConf 2016

Computers have been shrinking and multiplying in number for decades now, and with this change has come an accompanying increase in the architectural complexity of both infrastructure and the software which runs on it. This is silly: a computer is just a thing for running processes, and there should be little to no cognitive switching whether you’re running something on a single laptop or a thousand globally-distributed machines.
I’m going to show you how container technology and open-source software is rapidly closing this gap, moving us toward a world where the Internet is just another computer - a ridiculously big one.
