#Building Event-Driven Serverless Applications 
###Speaker: Danilo Poccia
###Date: 10-03-2016
###Conference event: CloudConf 2016

We built event-driven user interfaces for decades. What about bringing the same approach to mobile, web, and IoT backend applications? You have to understand how data flows and what is the propagation of changes, using reactive programming techniques. You can focus on the core functionalities to build and the relationships among the resources you use. Your application behaves similarly to a “spreadsheet”, where depending resources are updated automatically when something “happens”, and is decomposed into scalable microservices without having to manage the infrastructure,
The resulting architecture is efficient and cost effective to run on AWS and managing availability, scalability and security becomes part of the implementation itself.
