#Build a Python Environment on Cloud with Vagrant
###Speaker: Alessio Rocchi
###Date: 10-03-2016
###Conference event: CloudConf 2016

If we talk about continuous integration and deployment automation, we can consider Vagrant as a good option in order to automate the CI build process, create a virtual environment which run tests suite and build after having made changes. 
Moreover, Vagrant  also allows the user to fast deploy development environments using Vagrantfiles (which implement their specific syntax): this way, the user will be able to smoothly customize the setup spec, and easily interact with public cloud providers.
