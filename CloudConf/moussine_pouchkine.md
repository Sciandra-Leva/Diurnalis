#Google Cloud Vision API: What a Great Time to be a Developer!
###Speaker: Alexis Moussine-Pouchkine
###Date: 10-03-2016
###Conference event: CloudConf 2016

With everything that the Cloud has to offer nowadays it's really never been more exciting to be a developer.
We've had virtualized datacenters for a while now and these were great to get resources on demand, but an actual elastic global cloud is what we're starting to see emerge. So whether you are a startup CTO, a developer, or or an architect, you now have everything at you fingertips to test new ideas, to fail fast, to iterate, and to succeed. You can now scale your apps and data without having to rethink your architecture. You have open source technologies such as containers and Kubernetes to define workloads that can run in a public cloud, on premise, or in a hybrid model with no lock-in and yet an abstraction level that allows you to focus on your application, not on the underlying infrastructure.
And finally Google is working hard on making machine learning accessible to all and we'll see how the Google Cloud Vision API is opening up an entire new class of opportunities for application developers.
Really, there's never been a better time to be a developer!
